# etsy search example

### The UI could use some serious polish (I am **NOT** a designer),
but the desired functionality seems to work across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
I have not fully tested it in IE.
I debated adding requireJS to allow for the scripts to have dependencies,
but I decided to attempt with no libraries at all. Let's hope that doesn't bite me later.


   Things I would have liked to have gotten to:
   1. add some tests
   2. encapsulate some more of the dom logic
   3. add some transitions
